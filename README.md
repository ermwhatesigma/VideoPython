This is a script that opens a pygame windows and loads an selected mp4 so a video format into ASCII frames that open in a pygame window so you can achive around 30 to 60 fps.
Also the numbers behind the Video__.py are the frame size and the Video350-17.py is a 350 frame size and 17 pixels. The best for the video typh.mp4
